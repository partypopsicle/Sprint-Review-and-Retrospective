# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
Reflects on a sprint for SNHU Travel and compares agile vs waterfall in a powerpoint

After the term taking CS-250 and being able to take on different roles on an Agile-Scrum team. I was able to have a unique perspective on the pros and cons of an agile approach. And it gave me a sense of when it could work and how you could adapt it to work better for certain projects or teams. And how waterfall could be better for certain things. So, here are a few answers to common programming questions and my response after some experience. 

Question 1: How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Answer: User stories are basically customer demands or thoughts. If I show someone a device to make toast, someone might suggest that I add an option for different levels of toast, light medium and dark. Or perhaps make it easier to put the toast in. User stories are real examples of user input put into a readable format for the team to work on.

Question 2: How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Answer: I think everyone should approach developing programs as learning a new skill or creating something new for the first time. It will require patience and flexibility. Having it set a certain way in your mind will most likely lead to frustration be open to new ideas and methods. Also allocate time and people properly and keep communciation very open.

Question 3: What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Answer: It means to be communicative, supportive, hard working and curious. You want to be able to succeed and see your co workers succeed too. Make sure that you get help where you need it and communicate with everyone on what they are doing.
